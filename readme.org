* Gitoriousd â€“ the Gitorious daemon
   - Main executable in /usr/sbin/gitorious
     Responds to normal start, stop, status, restart, reload
   - Pids in /var/run/gitorious/$service.pid
   - Executables in /usr/libexec/gitorious/$service. All executable files in here will be run
   - /etc/gitorious.conf contains (at least) GITORIOUS_ROOT

   Each process should respond to {start,stop,status,restart,reload} and emit
   relevant exit codes

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
gitorious start: Starts all (non-running) processes from libexec
gitorious stop: Sends SIGQUIT to all running processes
gitorious restart: stop && restart
gitorious reload: Sends SIGHUP to all processes, which will cause them to reload config
[gitorious logrotate: Sends SIGUSR1 to all processes, which will cause them to reopen log files]
#+END_EXAMPLE
